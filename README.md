# RA-Lookup
Here's a Powershell module that will communicate with the RetroAchievements API (https://retroachievements.org/APIDemo.php) and allow you to capture public user profile data.<br>
<br>
The only requirement is that you enter your RetroAchievements username and API key when you import the module. You can run RA_GetCreds.ps1 in the module directory if you need to manually add your API key.
