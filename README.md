# RetroAchievements API-PowerShell
This Powershell module that will communicate with the [RetroAchievements API](https://retroachievements.org/APIDemo.php) and allow you to capture public user profile data.
 <br /><br />
## Requirements:
Every function will check for credentials and will prompt you for `user name` and `API key` if no credentials are found. Use the [RetroAchievements Control Panel](https://retroachievements.org/controlpanel.php) to find your Web API Key.
 <br /><br />
## In Progress: 
- Add missing functions (API Endpoints). 
- Complete help documentation for all functions. 
 <br /><br />
## Troubleshooting:
You may need to unblock the .psm1 files 

```
Unblock-File RA_Lookup.psm1
```
